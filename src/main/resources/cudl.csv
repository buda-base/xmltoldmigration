To date, only few verses of this tantra could have been read in the original Sanskrit. Although certainly less influential than other Yoginītantras, such as, in primis, the Hevajratantra, the Vajrāmṛtamahātantra must have enjoyed a certain popularity. For instance, it is referred to as one of the authoritative sources for the practice of the bāhyahoma by Bhūvācārya (early 11th cent. ?), the author of the Saṃvarodayā nāma Maṇḍalopāyikā, in the bāhyādhyātmahomavidhiḥ, the eleventh chapter of his work. In addition, we should point out that this tantra has been commented at least three times. Two of the commentaries are extant in the original Sanskrit but are still unpublished. Originally, Or.158 was formed of palm leaves from two independent manuscripts, both fragmentary, one containing the Vajrāmṛtatantra and one containing the Buddhakapālatantra, another yoginītantra, so far published only in part (Luo 2010). Since the ductus, the quality and the shape of the leaves comprising these two works is the same (each leaf contains six lines, one string-hole dividing the writing area into two pseudocolumns, of which the left one is smaller than the right one, and on average 64/65 akṣaras), it is likely that at some point someone got confused and mistakenly put together leaves from these two works according to an apparently correct numerical sequence. The folios of the two works have been now rearranged into two distinct bundles (Or.158.1 and Or.158.2), each containing the extant folios of each work. It is highly plausible that together with these two works, a third one, namely the Vajrāralimahātantrarāja, made originally part of the same collection. The clue for this is given by the short list of titles added by a different hand on the top left side of folio 1r. If this was the case, Or.158 could be considered to be a originally a composite and multi-text manuscript. On the right of the same recto we find some mantras written likely by the same hand (it is possible that the last two lines are instead written by a third hand; see under Additions).","A palm-leaf manuscript of the Vajrāmṛtatantra, one of the main Yoginītantras, which until now was known only through the",Vajrāmṛtatantra,,,Vajrāmṛtatantra,Vajrāmṛtamahātantra,https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/iiif/MS-OR-00158-00001,corypha_palm_leaf,,,1000132,Nepal.,,san,5,31,,"1,8"

The earliest evidence for texts grouped together as the ""Five Great Dhāraṇīs"" comes from Tibetan catalogues around 800 CE, but this compendium is somewhat different from the surviving Sanskrit collection, which is preserved in manuscripts dating back to the eleventh century. These scriptures include spells, enumerations of benefits and ritual instructions for use. With the course of time all of them became deified and five related goddesses emerged. It is, however, important to note that the texts themselves do not have any references to these goddesses. This ancient palm-leaf manuscript is dated to 1205 CE, and was thus written during the reign of king Arimalla (1200-1216). The last folio, a later supply in paper, seems to accurately repeat the content of the last folio of the palm leaf manuscript, which is now extremely damaged (and was probably already damaged at the time of the production of the supply). Therefore, with the help of the transcription in the last folio, it is possible to reconstruct the original date, even if it is badly damaged in the original colophon (as Bendall puts it, ""[t]he date is especially remarkable, as it seems a clear instance of a copied date""; 1883: 153). Moreover, on the verso of the last palm-leaf folio, ""are the remains of a postscript in a finer and later hand, in Newari, with half-obliterated, but still certain, date, N.S. 579 (A.D. 1459).""

In this manuscript each sūtra (i.e. rule) is separated from the commentary to the previous sūtra by a double daṇḍa followed by a small blank and another double daṇḍa, thus facilitating their identification despite the poor condition of the folios.

MS-ADD-01643,"An 11th-century composite and multi-text manuscript containing three texts: Rāhulabhadra 's Prajñāpāramitāstotra, the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā and the Vajradhvajapariṇāmanā. The ""Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines"" (Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā) is one of the earliest Mahāyāna scriptures. This foundational sūtra of Mahāyāna Buddhism developed gradually over a period of about two hundred years, from the first century BCE to the first century CE (some of its earliest recensions were translated into Chinese during the Han dynasty, 206 BC – 220 CE). There is still no scholarly consensus as to the provenance of the text, but the most widespread view is that it was probably written in central or southern India. The ""Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines"" presents its doctrine in the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and one of his disciples, the arhat Subhūti. In this dialogue ""the principal ontological message (message concerning what ultimately exists) […] is an extension of the Buddhist teaching of not-Self to equal no essential unchanging core, therefore no fundamentally real existence, as applied to all things without exception"" (Williams 2009; 52). This sūtra belongs to the early stratum of the so-called ""Perfection of Wisdom (prajñāpāramitā) literature,"" subsequently expanded between the second and fourth centuries CE into other huge scriptures, for instance the ""Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines"" (the Śatasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā). The ""Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Stanzas"" enjoyed a central role in the Buddhist cult of the book, and particularly in Newar Buddhism. ""This Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā is a unique item under many aspects. It is an important historical document that provides valuable information about the dynastic history of medieval Nepal. According to the colophon, it was written by a scribe named Sujātabhadra in 1015 CE during the joint reign of three kings, Bhojadeva , Rudradeva and Lakṣmīkāmadeva in the Hlāṃ vihāra (on the joint reign of these three kings cf. Petech 1984: 36-9). The identification of this monastery is still open: according to L. Petech it might be a misreading for Hloṃ, and is ""perhaps connected with present-day Lhom Hit in Tangal Tol, Patan"" (Petech 1984: 36-7); on the other hand, J. Locke identifies it with the Lām Bāhā in Kathmandu (Locke 1985: 421). Moreover, it is decorated with 85 miniatures occurring at chapter ends and at the beginning of the entire manuscript (probably the miniatures were originally 88, since the first palm-leaf folio is missing and has been replaced with a paper supplement). The subjects of these miniatures 'are in general different from their Indian Pāla counterparts. Apart from the last eight on the colophon folio […] they are all of specific iconographic representations of the Buddha or Bodhisattvas or other divinities, or of important stūpas or caityas. The majority of places designated are in eastern India, but there are some from far off places-China, Java, Ceylon, Gujarat, southern India' (Losty 1992: 31). Moreover, the manuscript contains notes for the illuminator added by the first scribe, each of which describes the Buddha or the Bodhisattva and the location to be depicted in the miniature. The importance of this manuscript is furthermore confirmed by an additional colophon in verses, added in 1139 by a certain Karuṇavajra , who states that he rescued the Prajñāpāramitā from falling in the hands of unbelievers (most probably, people of Brahmanical affiliation).

MS-ADD-02121,"This manuscript is the only known copy of the Dhātupārāyaṇa of Pūrṇacandra, a commentary on the Dhātupāṭha of the Cāndravyākaraṇa, listing the verbal roots of the Sanskrit language accompanied by concise meaning entries. As noted by Liebich (1902), who used this manuscript for his edition of the Cāndra Dhātupāṭha, in the extant portion of the work the treatment of the roots of each of the ten verbal classes (gaṇas) is confined to the present tense, called with the artificial term laṭ in the Cāndra and Pāṇinian terminology. The term appears in fact in the section rubrics of the manuscript. Liebich also remarks that the commentary shows traces of the influence of other Dhātupāṭha traditions (Pāṇini and Kātantra) despite Pūrṇacandra’s affiliation to the Cāndra school, which is shown e.g. by the form of the pratyāhārasūtras found at the beginning of the work. The bundle also contains three additional folios, of seemingly related content, whose connection with the rest of the work is uncertain. The Dhātupārāyaṇa is as yet unpublished. According to Liebich (1895, p. 7) and, more recently, Verhagen (1994, p. 110 and 119), Pūrṇacandra’s work was known to the Tibetan grammatical tradition and was used by native translators of the Cāndra Dhātupāṭha. Nothing is known of Pūrṇacandra, but he is mentioned as the author of the Śabdalakṣaṇavivaraṇapañjikā, also unpublished, possibly a sub-commentary on the Cāndravyākaraṇapañjikā of Ratnamati (cf. Add.1657.1), which is preserved in a single 12th-century manuscript in the Kaiser Library in Kathmandu (see the online catalogue of NGMCP, reel no.

Rāmapāla was one of the four main disciples of Maitreyanātha . The title of the text could be translated into English as ""Commentary on the Explanation of Consecration."" The latter was written by Maitreyanātha in accord with the teachings of the Sequence of the Four Seals (Caturmudrānvaya) by a certain Nāgārjuna. The text starts with an explanation of the mystical word evam and its Tantric symbolism. Then it continues with an explanation of the four moments (kṣaṇa) and the related blisses (ānanda) that are to be experienced during the higher phase of the initiation. The text and in particular the commentary refer to a debate between different Buddhist traditions regarding the sequence of the blisses and the nature of their experience, and its significance. Rāmapāla quotes several stanzas from the Pramāṇavārttika by Dharmakīrti and many passages from other Mahāyānic and Tantric works (in particular from the Hevajratantra).

MS-ADD-01380-01381,"A modern manuscript containing the Kauśīdyavīryotsāhanāvadāna and the Snātāvadāna. In Bendall's catalogue (1883) this manuscript is described under two different classmarks, Add.1380 (Snātāvadāna) and Add.1381 ( Kauśighavīryotsāhanāvadāna(!) ), as if it were two distinct manuscripts. However, many common features points to the fact that they are two parts of one single manuscript (paper, folio dimensions, layout and script are identical in the two). Moreover, in Add.1381 the foliation ends with 11, while in Add.1380 it begins with 12 (and not 11, as stated in Bendall 1883: 80). These two avadānas belong to the cycle of king Aśoka and the monk Upagupta, and are versified versions from the Ratnāvadānamālā. In the edition by Takahata (1954), the frame story of the Kauśīdyavīryotsāhanāvadāna consists of only four stanzas and is different from the one found in the present manuscript. His edition is based mainly on a manuscript kept in the Kyōto University Library, but in the critical apparatus he states that the longer version in nine stanzas is witnessed in four other manuscripts used by him (it is also present in a manuscript microfilmed by the Nepal-German Manuscripts Preservation Project [NGMCP] with reel No. A 117-9, acc. No. NAK 3/596, and the title Avadānaratnamālā). Parallel versions of the stories can be found in other collections, like the Avadānaśataka (II.3, Snātāvadāna; I.3, Kuśīdāvadāna).

MS-ADD-01464,"A palm-leaf manuscripts containing Rāhulabhadra 's Prajñāpāramitāstotra and the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā. The 'Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines' (Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā) is one of the earliest Mahāyāna scriptures. This foundational sūtra of Mahāyāna Buddhism developed gradually over a period of about two hundred years, from the first century BCE to the first century CE (some of its earliest recensions were translated into Chinese during the Han dynasty, 206 BC – 220 CE). There is still no scholarly consensus as to the provenance of the text, but the most widespread view is that it was probably written in central or southern India. The 'Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines' presents its doctrine in the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and one of his disciples, the arhat Subhūti. In this dialogue ""the principal ontological message (message concerning what ultimately exists) […] is an extension of the Buddhist teaching of not-Self to equal no essential unchanging core, therefore no fundamentally real existence, as applied to all things without exception"" (Williams 2009; 52). This sūtra belongs to the early stratum of the so-called 'Perfection of Wisdom (prajñāpāramitā) literature,' subsequently expanded between the second and fourth centuries CE into other huge scriptures, for instance the 'Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines' (the Śatasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā). The 'Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Stanzas' enjoyed a central role in the Buddhist cult of the book, and particularly in Newar Buddhism. This palm-leaf manuscript belongs to the Pāla tradition of illuminated manuscripts of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā in the ornamental Pāla script. The manuscript originally had six illuminated folios, each with three miniatures, but unfortunately the original first folio is missing. It has been replaced with a later palm-leaf folio without miniatures and in a different script. The date of the manuscript is controversial since in the colophon it is stated that it was copied in the fifth regnal year of the Pāla king Mahīpāla, but without specifying which of the two Pāla kings named Mahīpāla is meant. The fifth year of either is equivalent to c. 985 or after ca 1070, and since Mahīpāla II most probably reigned only for three years, the earliest date is more probable.

MS-ADD-01343,"This Nepalese paper manuscript contains the Saptavāra, the Mañjuśrīnāmasaṅgīti and the Daśabalastavastotra. The Saptavāra ‘Seven Days’ usually incorporates the Vasudhārā (substituted in this manuscript by the Vasundhārānāmāṣṭottaraśataka), Vajravidāraṇā, Gaṇapatihṛdayā, Uṣṇīṣavijayā, Parṇaśavarī/Prajñāpāramitā, Mārīcī, and Grahamātṛkā. This collection associates each dhāraṇī with a specific day of the week, a tradition going back to at least the sixteenth century in Nepal. The Mañjuśrīnāmasaṅgīti is a popular Buddhist tantric work, which consists primarily of 162 verses associated with Mañjuśrī, the Bodhisattva of wisdom. The Daśabalastavastotra is a Buddhist hymn to the ten powers of an illuminated being. According to the colophon placed at the end of the Mañjuśrīnāmasaṅgīti, the manuscript was written in Kathmandu (Kāṣṭhamaṇḍapa), probably in the Tarumūla Mahāvihāra (written taramūdra), in 1663 CE, under the reign of Jayapratāpa Malla (1641-1674), and it was commissioned by a monk named Ratnasiṃha ."," This Nepalese paper manuscript contains the Saptavāra, the Mañjuśrīnāmasaṅgīti and the Daśabalastavastotra.

It is in three parts: the first part (in prose and verse) deals with the definition of a real brahmin (brāhmaṇa), and was sometimes read as a critique of the caste system; the second part (in prose and verse) considers various notions of liberation (mokṣa); the third part (prose only) deals with the interpretation of the upaniṣadic “Great Sayings” (mahāvākyas).

MS-ADD-01278,"This Nepalese paper manuscript, dated 1866 CE, contains a Tantric Buddhist text called Sarvadurgatipariśodhanasamādhi, , belonging to the Sarvadurgatipariśodhana cycle. Most of the textual material of the present work is included in the so-called Version B of the Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatantra (see Skorupski 1983: xviii), where it susbtitues the 'Basic Tantra' (consisting of the description of the ritual maṇḍala). In the present text, the rite for the elimination of all evil destinies, aimed at procuring a better rebirth for the dead and a a better life for the living, is described in its different elements (for instance, the various mantras, the visualization of maṇḍalas, the transference of merits, the vow for the development of the supreme Enlightment-mind, Skt. bodhicitta etc.). This manuscript seems to give particular importance to the hand-gestures (mudrās) to be perfomed during the rite, which are carefully depicted in numerous polychrome illustrations throughout the book. As in the case of many other ritual texts from Nepal, the manuscript is an accordion book (or concertina), the ideal format to be read and consulted during the performance of often complex ritual practices. Possibly, the colophon recorded also the name of the owner of this manuscript, which has subsequently been erased (probably due to some change of ownership).","This Nepalese paper manuscript, dated 1866 CE, contains a Tantric Buddhist text called Sarvadurgatipariśodhanasamādhi, ,",Sarvadurgatipariśodhanasamādhi,,,Sarvadurgatipariśodhanasamādhi,"Ādiyogasamādhi,Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatantra",https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/iiif/MS-ADD-01278,nep_multi_layered_paper,,,1000132,Nepal.,nepālākṣarā,san,8,17,"5,3","13,5"

CE, and who also wrote works in Sinhalese and Pāli under the name of Upatissa.

The 'Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines' (Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā) is one of the earliest Mahāyāna scriptures. This foundational sūtra of Mahāyāna Buddhism developed gradually over a period of about two hundred years, from the first century BCE to the first century CE (some of its earliest recensions were translated into Chinese during the Han dynasty, 206 BC – 220 CE). There is still no scholarly consensus as to the provenance of the text, but the most widespread view is that it was probably written in central or southern India. The 'Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines' presents its doctrine in the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and one of his disciples, the arhat Subhūti. In this dialogue ""the principal ontological message (message concerning what ultimately exists) […] is an extension of the Buddhist teaching of not-Self to equal no essential unchanging core, therefore no fundamentally real existence, as applied to all things without exception"" (Williams 2009; 52). This sūtra belongs to the early stratum of the so-called 'Perfection of Wisdom (prajñāpāramitā) literature,' subsequently expanded between the second and fourth centuries CE into other huge scriptures, for instance the 'Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines' (the Śatasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā).
