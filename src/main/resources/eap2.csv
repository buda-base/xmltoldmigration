This project was launched with the aim of preserving the manuscripts held in the temples of Dongkarla, Chizhi, Phajoding and Dodedra in digital copies. The three temples hold significant collections of ancient manuscripts such as Buddhist canonical texts, religious and philosophical writings, historical and biographical literatures, which have hitherto remained unknown and inaccessible to scholars. Beside photographing the collections in these four archives as planned, the project also managed to cover four other temples of Phurdogkha, Menrikha, Thujedra and Pumola, which are located close to Phajoding.",
